### Aayush Upendra Pagare
#### A Software Developer

With 1.6 years of experience in software engineering, I specialize in web development with a strong proficiency in the JavaScript stack. My expertise lies in backend development, though I also possess foundational knowledge of frontend technologies. I've had the privilege of working on diverse projects, including a Fintech, Slack app development, and automation projects, alongside senior professionals with over 7 years of experience, successfully implementing many user stories and requirements single-handedly and managed an intern under me. Passionate about contributing to innovative projects, I thrive in startup environments where I can help bring new products to life. Eager to learn and embrace new challenges, I'm currently expanding my skills in machine learning to stay at the forefront of technology and innovation.
