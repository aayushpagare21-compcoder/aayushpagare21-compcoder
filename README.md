Hey, I'm Aayush ðŸ‘‹
I'm a full-stack developer by day and a technical writer by night.

I worked as a Software Developer at [Matlabinfotech](https://www.matlabinfotech.com) for 1 year and 9 months, where I gained experience in technologies like Nest.js, React.js, PostgreSQL, Prisma, Snowflake, DBT, and Jest. I also contributed to an exciting project, developing a Slack bot to automate workflows within the company.

During weekends, my fascination with Docker inspired me to build a remote code execution project, exploring containerization and secure execution environments.

Wanting to build an app end-to-end and explore Generative AI technologies, I created AspirantsAI. Using the Next.js framework, I handled everything from frontend and backend development to database management and deployment.

I write technical blogs to share insights, document learnings, and contribute to the developer community. Check my [medium](https://medium.com/@aayushpagare21) profile.

I am enthusiastic about remote work and collaborative opportunities worldwide, eager to contribute to impactful projects irrespective of geographical boundaries.
