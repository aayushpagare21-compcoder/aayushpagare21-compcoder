### Aayush Upendra Pagare

With 1.6 years of experience in software engineering, I specialize in web development with a strong proficiency in the JavaScript stack, focusing primarily on backend development while also gaining experience in frontend technologies. I've contributed to diverse projects including a Fintech application, few local projects and a Slack app and automation project, and a personal project focused on remote code execution.

Throughout my career, I've benefited from mentorship by seasoned professionals with over 7+ years of industry experience. This guidance has been instrumental in my growth, as I've had the opportunity to train interns and refine my skills in Agile methodologies, ensuring efficient and collaborative project execution.

Looking forward, I'm keen to explore machine learning and apply my skills in startup environments. I thrive in dynamic teams where I can contribute to the development of new products and innovate alongside talented colleagues.

Additionally, I am enthusiastic about remote work and collaborative opportunities worldwide, eager to contribute to impactful projects irrespective of geographical boundaries.
