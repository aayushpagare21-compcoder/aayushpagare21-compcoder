### Aayush Upendra Pagare

With 2 years of experience in software engineering, I specialize in web development with a strong proficiency in the JavaScript stack, focusing primarily on backend development while also gaining experience in frontend technologies. I've contributed to projects like a Fintech application, a Slack app workflow automation project, and a personal project focused on remote code execution.

Throughout my career, I've benefited from mentorship by seasoned professionals with over 7+ years of industry experience. This guidance has been instrumental in my growth, as I've had the opportunity to train interns and refine my skills in Agile methodologies, ensuring efficient and collaborative project execution.

I am enthusiastic about remote work and collaborative opportunities worldwide, eager to contribute to impactful projects irrespective of geographical boundaries.
